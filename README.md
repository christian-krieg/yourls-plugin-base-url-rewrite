# Rewrite BaseURL [![Listed in Awesome YOURLS!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Awesome-YOURLS-C5A3BE)](https://github.com/YOURLS/awesome-yourls/)

<!-- Once you have committed code, get your plugin listed in Awesome YOURLS ! See https://github.com/YOURLS/awesome-yourls -->

Tested with [YOURLS](https://yourls.org), version `1.9.2`.

## Usage

Configuration option for the "Custom shortlink base URL" plugin.

Defines the base URL of the shortlinks generated by Yourls. This base URL can
be different from the domain from which Yourls is served.  Rewrite short links
such that they point to another (base) domain (e.g., https://acme.com/r), which
can be helpful if you want to serve Yourls from a sub-domain (e.g.,
https://link.acme.com), but generate short links for a sub-directory of the
domain for your main web presence (e.g., https://acme.com/r).

If the shortlink base URL is not defined, the short link base URL is the same as
``YOURLS_SITE`` (as defined in `config.php`).

:bulb: NOTE: You must take care that the other end (e.g., https://acme.com/r)
performs redirects to the site where Yourls is served from (e.g.
https://link.acme.com).
